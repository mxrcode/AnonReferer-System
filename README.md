# AnonReferer-System
Plugin that works with links in Xenforo 2.x.x. Hiding from guests. Hiding referer, Whitelist/mirrorlist, etc.

## Features
- Hiding links from guests,
- Hiding the referer on links,
- Whitelist support,
- List of Mirrors - Domain substitution for links to the current domain used by a specific user.

*All domains used by the forum must be included in the Mirror List, even if there is only one domain.*<br/>
*Colors can be edited in anonreferrersystem_style.less template*

*The plugin was developed in 2018, the implementation, variable names, etc. cannot be a good code example for Xenforo. But it is still maintained by me, and works correctly on the latest versions.*
